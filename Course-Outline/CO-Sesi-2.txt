======================================================

[] GC and AT Composition on DNA
[] Melting Point of DNA
[] Nucleotide Molecular Weight

Notes:
- Teach how to calculate the composition and percentage of GC and AT in a DNA sequence.
- Teach how to calculate the melting point of a DNA sequence using the Wallace rule, GC content, and the nearest neighbor thermodynamic method.
- Teach how to calculate the molecular weight of a DNA sequence.
